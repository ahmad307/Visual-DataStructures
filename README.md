# Visual-DataStructures
A Desktop application that displays a visualized version of some of the well known data-structures (e.g. HashTable) depending on info provided by the user. The user can add or insert new elements and see how the container changes.

## Aim
The project's main goal is to be a reference for developers getting to learn data-structures, that does more than explaining the abstract concept and gives a glimpse into how these data-structures are implmented in c++ standard library.

## Tool
Built using C++ and SFML.

## What's in the Repo
The main folder in this repository is a Visual Studio 2017 project consisting of several classes, where the user gets to enter input through a console window and then the chosen class gets displayed in a SFML window.
